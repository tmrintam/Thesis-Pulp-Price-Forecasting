# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This will be my Pro Gradu thesis work in Vaasa School of Economics. I will write forecasting model for Pulp prices. Pulp is raw material for paper or cardboard production.


## Background

I have been working in forest industri basically all my life. I wanted that my thesis is more writing code than writing text. I am interested in how Pulp market works, because Pulp and paper export are significant number of Finnish (or swedish) GDP.

Pulp is quite interesting raw material, because price is negotiated once in month, between seller and buyer. So its not like stocks or oil, which are traded every day. 


## How is it used?
Very good question. I will be update this later.


## Data sources and AI methods

I have got pulp price index from 1996->2020. Other data sources are not clear yet. 

## Challenges

Can I find input variables which affect to price? Are these datasets available for free?

## What next?

Probably make this model somehow more useful. How pulp price affect to stock market...?
